I found out about Vera Molnar through an SFPC post inviting applications to their Recreating the Past class in October 2021. I had applied to the class but lacking a scholarship, I could not join it. However, I was very intrigued.

From the class description
> In Recreating the Past, we will study computational art from the past decades, and co-create our own computational art histories through recreating the works of artists who inspire us. We will use contemporary techniques to gain aesthetic, analytical and technical knowledge, and study the contexts from which these artistsâ€™ works emerged to better understand the politics, communities of practice, and social and artistic movements they engaged in. 

By late 2021, it had already been a little more than 3 years of me working with Processing and p5.js, and about 2 of me teaching it. While I was still very interested in it (and to this day), the initial period of chaotic explorations in every possible direction was coming to a close. The class intrigued me, and when I couldn't participate, I did my own homework. 

Somewhere in the class description I found mention of a couple of artists, Vera Molnar being one of them. Some scattershot googling later, the magnitude of her work started to dawn on me. Further digging led me to one of the best resources that I have discovered to date on generative art and artists - [Spalter Digital](https://spalterdigital.com/).

[Spalter Digital's page on Vera Molnar](https://spalterdigital.com/artists/vera-molnar/) was a treasure trove of her works, and I decided I had to get about to recreating these. This was my intrinsic reaction to seeing her work, as well as the primary task of the RTP class I so wanted to be in. Deeper critiques and analyses aside, the work seemed so accessible, so simple, yet with so many variations possible, that I needed to code it.
